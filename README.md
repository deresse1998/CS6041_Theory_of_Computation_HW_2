# CS6041 Theory of Computation HW_2
Homework 2: Write a program that simulate the execution of the following FAs. You need to implement GUI (Graphic User Interface).
1) a PDA that recognizes the language {w: w is a palindrome}.
2) a PDA that recognizes the language 0^n 1^n
3) a CFL that generates the language L={w: w is a palindrome}. Your CFL can generate any string belonging to the language L input by other people.

Basically, in the GUI, if I input any string to your program, each machine will show the process of accepting or reject. When each machine moves from one state to another state, you need to highlight the new state.

You may form a group with 2 to 4 persons. If your group has less than 2 person, you need to contact me. Each group needs to do a 5 min presentation on Oct 31.

Each student in the group will be graded equally unless it was reported to me and confirmed that some student did not do sufficient work for the project.
For online students, you need to record a video with your group members and upload it to D2L. If an in-class student group contains an online student, the online student has to come to the classroom for the presentation.
